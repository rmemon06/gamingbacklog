    "description": "Alot of people hate this game but I think its an absolute masterpiece, although I did not think that after my first play through because it is very disjointed and difficult to follow but once you overcome the random jumps between characters and points in time it is a masterclass in writing. People that hate Joels ... and people who hate Abby are stupid because they're what make the story so good. That's not even including the fact the gameplay is as smooth as butter and 100x better than the first game. ",
